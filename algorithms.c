/*  Welcome! This file contains C implementations of many of the algorithms presented in Anany
 *  Levitin's textbook "Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms." The file, like the
 *  textbook, organizes algorithms into seven design classes: brute-force, decrease-and-conquer,
 *  divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, the greedy technique, and iterative improvement. The
 *  file is intended to be read sequentially, but I have tried to document my code comprehensively
 *  enough that you may read the implementation of any particular algorithm in isolation.
 *
 *  Each algorithm is preceded by a comment that (a) documents its usage as a C function, (b)
 *  sketches the idea of the algorithm in prose, and (c) analyzes the time and space complexity.
 *  Details of the algorithm's implementation are documented as inline comments in the code.
 *
 *  Basic knowledge of C is required to understand these algorithms. I have avoided hacks and
 *  optimizations whenever they would reduce the clarity of the code, and I have made some
 *  simplifications of implementation, for example only writing sorting algorithms for arrays of
 *  integers. For these two reasons, the functions here should not be taken as substitutes for
 *  canonical implementations.
 *
 *  The bulk of this file consists of the algorithms themselves. At the bottom are implementations
 *  of the utility functions defined in algorithms.h, and a test suite and main function.

/* Sort the elements of `array` in place.
 *
 *   Idea: Find the smallest number and swap it with the first element. Find the second smallest
 *   number and swap it with the second element, and so on until the list is sorted.
 *
 *   Time analysis: The outer loop runs n times, so n swaps are made. When i=0, the inner loop
 *   runs n-1 times, when i=1 n-2 times, and so on for a total of n-1 + n-2 + ... + 1 times,
 *   which equals n(n-1)/2. This is asymptotically equivalent to n^2, so O(n^2) comparisons are
 *   made. Therefore the overall time complexity is O(n^2).
 *
 *   Space analysis: No extra space is used, so O(1).
